[Session material](https://viaucdk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rib_viauc_dk/Ehw3HAQLiH5OuSB14MmZb5gBZxQvOeMDPqkRz7Jvg2hBjw?e=ADVcEv)



## Topics
This lecture will cover basic machine learning methodology, the logistic regression algorithm, and the k Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

After attending this lecture and reading the corresponding part of the book, I expect you to be able to:

- Explain what is meant by the term Machine Learning (ML)
- Explain what is meant by supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Explain the overall difference between classification and regression
- Describe the "train-test" methodology
- Train a logistic regression (LR) and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on a dataset in sklearn
- Explain the principles behind the kNN algorithm
- Explain the key ideas behind logistic regression, and implement a logistic regression classifier in python.
- Explain the concept of “maximum likelihood” and how it is used.
- Explain and use L1 and L2 regularization in the context of logistic regression, and discuss the difference between these approaches, as well as the importance of the hyperparameter C.
- Discuss advantages and disadvantages of logistic regression.
- Explain what is meant by the "hyperparameters" of an algorithm
