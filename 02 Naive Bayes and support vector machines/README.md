## Topics
This lecture will delve into more sophisticated classification methods within machine learning. We will explore the theory and application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers.

After attending this lecture and reading the corresponding part of the book, I expect you to be able to:

- Explain the key concepts of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, including the concepts of hyperplanes and kernels.
- Implement a Support Vector Machine classifier using sklearn, and apply it to real-world datasets.
- Understand the probabilistic foundations of the Naive Bayes classifier and its assumptions about feature independence.
- Describe the different types of Naive Bayes classifiers (e.g., Gaussian, Multinomial) and their appropriate application contexts.
- Apply a Naive Bayes classifier to text data and other types of datasets using sklearn.
- Discuss the concept of hyperparameters in the context of SVM and Naive Bayes, and demonstrate how to tune them to improve model performance.
