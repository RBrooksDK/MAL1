For a very appealing and visual explanation of SVD, you should take a look at [Visual Kernel's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSczTbgc8Rc&list=PLWhu9osGd2dB9uMG5gKBARmk73oHUUQZS&index=4) video on the topic.

Expect this session to last more than two lessons.


## Topics
In today's session we look at some of the math behind Machine Learning. Ideally, you would have had both a course in Linear Algebra and Probability theory before starting up on Machine Learning, but in this session we will try to mediate this:

- Introduction to the importance of mathematics in machine learning.
- The role of linear algebra in representing data and models.
- The significance of GPUs and matrix operations in machine learning.
- Viewing linear algebra through the lens of programming concepts.
- Applications of linear algebra techniques like SVD in machine learning.

After attending this lecture and/or watching the video, I expect you to be able to:
- Understand why mathematics, particularly linear algebra, calculus, and statistics, is fundamental to machine learning and its optimization processes
- Gain knowledge on how linear algebra facilitates the representation of machine learning data, models, and computations using arrays and matrices.
- Recognize the critical role of GPUs and matrix operations in enhancing the efficiency and capabilities of machine learning algorithms.
- Develop an intuitive grasp of linear algebra by relating it to programming concepts.
- Learn about the application of linear algebra techniques, such as Singular Value Decomposition, in processing and optimizing machine learning data and models.
