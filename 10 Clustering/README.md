## Topics
This lecture covers **clustering** algorithms. We cover the following algorithms:

- k means
- Hierarchical clustering
- DBSCAN

After attending this lecture, reading the corresponding part of the book and doing exercises, I expect you to be able to:

- Describe the following clustering algorithms along with their advantages and disadvantages:
  - k-Means
  - Agglomerative clustering
  - DBSCAN
- Apply the above clustering algorithms in Python
- Evaluate clustering algorithms (e.g. by inspecting the output in 2D-plots or in other ways inspecting which elements are clustered together).
- Use a dendrogram to determine the optimal number of clusters
