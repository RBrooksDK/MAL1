[Steve Brunton](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNSVjnsviglFoY2nXildDCcv&si=q7-RepDmv-fnb5PH) has made a whole lecture series about the SVD. This is overkill but maybe check out the the Overview and the videoes about PCA.

For a very appealing and visual explanation of SVD, you should take a look at [Visual Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSczTbgc8Rc&list=PLWhu9osGd2dB9uMG5gKBARmk73oHUUQZS&index=4)'s video on the topic.

Useful Resources on t-SNE:

[How to Use t-SNE Effectively](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/)

[openTSNE](https://opentsne.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

[Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html)

I've also added the original research papers leading up to t-SNE (not part of syllabus, just there for reference)

If you want a really in depth introduction to t-SNE, look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnRskV3NY1k)

And as always, Alexander Ihler is gold.

## Topics
This lecture covers **unsupervised machine learning** algorithms. We discuss how these can be used for dimensionality reduction. We cover the following algorithms:

- Principal component analysis (PCA)
- t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)

After attending this lecture, reading the corresponding part of the book and doing exercises, I expect you to be able to:

- Use principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of your dataset
- Describe how PCA can be used for clustering analyses
- Create 2-dimensional clustering-plots in python using PCA and t-SNE

If you missed the session in linear algebra, I recommend checking out some of the resources mentioned above.
