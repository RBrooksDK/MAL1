## Topics
This lecture will cover the basics of how to prepare a data set for machine learning and add new features based on those already in the data set. The topic includes:

- Data cleaning: What to do with missing values, outliers, nonsensical values
- Box Plots and other exploratory visualisations
- Data imputation
- Feature engineering:
  - Dummy variables
  - Scaling

After attending this lecture, reading the corresponding part of the book and doing exercises, I expect you to be able to:

- Know how to approach features and when to drop and/or engineer them for your specific purposes
- Prepare a dataset for ML. Specifically, you should be able to explain and perform each of the operations below:
  - Handle missing values/NaN-values in appropriate ways
  - Identify and handle outliers using a boxplot
  - Create dummy variables
  - Scale/normalize variables
  - Create a bag-of-words-representation for text-data
