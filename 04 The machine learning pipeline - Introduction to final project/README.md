## Material:

Ch 2 (also for next week)

[Session material](https://viaucdk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rib_viauc_dk/En7Ef2yZyHhMkOI3_uXMGwwBuzJLWso-eMq76QprbQvZNA?e=Imq1ob)


## Topics
In this session we will go through how to complete a Machine Learning project from defining the problem to building the final model:

1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.

In addition, we will go through your final group project.

After attending this lecture, reading the corresponding part of the book and doing exercises, I expect you to be able to:

- Define and articulate the scope of a Machine Learning problem, including understanding the big picture and setting clear objectives.
- Acquire and prepare datasets for Machine Learning projects, understanding the complexity of real-world data and the importance of pre-processing.
- Understand the relevance of exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and trends within the data, utilizing visualization techniques to aid in understanding.
- Understand why it is essential to perform model optimization and fine-tuning techniques to improve performance and achieve robustness in predictions, including understanding the importance of hyperparameter tuning.
